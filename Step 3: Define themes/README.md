##### Background: The Devrel Funnel [15 min]

```
"A handshake is worth more than a click" - Tim Falls
```
There are many reasons to engage in developer relations. Some of these are listed here:
- build awareness
- get usage
- trust
- credibility
- nurture long-term relationships
- explain complicated tech to people who know more than you
- encourage peer support & recommendation
- value customers even if the person's company cannot pay for your product right now

These reasons all align with some part of the devrel funnel. This devrel funnel is closely related and based on the AARRP (?) funnel which has been extended by [Phil Leggetter](https://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/02/03/defining-developer-relations.html). Note that at each stage of the funnel some drop off occurs. People that are in the late stages of the funnel are generally heavily invested. Those are the people that you can bug more with questions and who will likely want to give you feedback on your product.

```
\                /- Awareness (of the platform and what it does)
 \              /- Acquisition (e.g. registration, sign-up, download, install)
  \            /- Activation  (e.g. first API call, active usage in app)
   \          /- Retention (e.g. active users after 30/60/90 days, use of new features)
    \        /- Revenue (e.g. users that pay to use the platform)
     \      /- Referral (rare but valuable -> community champions)
      \    /- Product (involvement in building and getting feedback on product)
```

To help with the understanding of where typical initiatives fall Phil provides a handy disambiguation:

Blogging, conference and meet-up talks, as well as hosting meet-ups and peer commentary can cause developers to become aware of your product. **Awareness** can be broad or deep, depending on, for example, what type of blog posts are written, what you do when you attend conferences, and what kind of talks you give at meet-ups.

From awareness, we generally want developers to go further. The AIDA model ... Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action.

**Acquisition** comes from activities like blogging, personal interaction, or meetups. It is important to meet developers where they are. On top of that, marketing should never be obnoxious to developers. When talking about the competition, it is best to stay graceful. If the competition is the better choice for your user, tell them that. Misleading developers causes more harm in the long run to your numbers and your reputation.

From acquisition, the next step is **activation**. This can be helped with documentation, quick-start apps, great SDKs and good support. The focus here should be to make developers successful. If the drop off between acquisition and activation can be measured and seems too high, this can be an indicator of problems in the onboarding user experience.

Once your developers are on your platform and have made their first API calls, you want to make sure they stay for a while. **Retention** can be achieved by providing a community around the products and, of course, great documentation. Keeping track of users' activities can indicate user experience issues, documentation issues, or community issues.

Revenue

One of the last stages in the funnel is the **referral** stage. This is where you want to ensure that staying in your community is worthwhile for users.

The last stage is **product**, where developers contribute back to your product development. In this stage there is general quite a bit of personal interaction and community work. Acknowledging people for their contributions can go a long way.

If you locate any significant drop offs, these are areas that you can work on improving. Note that some drop off is normal and you should not expect every user to advance through to the referral or product stages.

##### 1. Where in this funnel should our team be? [20 min]

Here the organization overview chart from [Step 2](../Step\ 2:\ Know\ your\ team\ \&\ initiatives) will come in handy. You should not focus on the entire funnel. If you have many teams that are in this space, ensure that any overlap makes sense. This may be different for the different products. It may stretch over multiple parts of the funnel.

Bonus: If you have metrics for different parts of the funnel, this will help you figure out where your focus should be. Look for obvious drop offs that you could address.

##### 2. Articulate concrete themes [25 min]

Which part of the funnel will you work on for which product? Will you be increasing awareness for your product? Should you be working on increasing retention? Themes that work for one company will not work for other companies so make sure to base your choices on your situation. Do not choose more than 2 overall themes to avoid stretching yourselves too thin.

##### 2. Articulate mission statement [25 min]

"What developer relations should mean to a company really depends on what the company's goals are." - Phil Leggeter
