# Step 6: [120 min] Documentation

## Outcomes

- An organized set of resources that will allow all stakeholders to understand what it is you are doing, why you are doing it, and how success will be measured.

## Introduction

This is the final step which can be completed by the planning leader after the training. The completed documentation will be invaluable to keeping you goal-oriented and it will give you a baseline to compare your progress to after and during the next quarter(s).

It's incredibly important that it is completed as the documentation will serve as a clear reference point to the team and all involved stakeholders. This resource should be as accessible as possible to everyone in the organization.

## Preparation
- [ ] Decide where the instruction manuals should live (GitHub/Google Drive/...) and ensure this is accessible to the team.

## Tasks

### 1. Documentation [120 min]

The task is to pull all documentation created into an overall strategy document/folder. You can do this alone or as a team.

If you want to create one overall document you can find a template in [outline-template.md](outline-template.md).

## Notes

- As you work through all the created materials from the sessions, make sure to follow up on loose ends and assign action items.
