Developer Relations Strategy - *IN FIVE STEPS*
---------------------------------------------------

You have stumbled upon the guide to creating a Strategy for your (team's) developer relations work.

### Is this for me?
This guide features information and multiple exercises designed to help you define your (team's) strategy. You may find that some exercises fit better than others and that you need to add/change content for your team's needs.

### The summary
A strategy is a framework for understanding what the right thing to do is and a tool for knowing roughly how you are going to achieve your goals.
In this guide I will take you through multiple steps. The first step will be the creation of an **analysis of your current situation**. From there we will discuss what your **overarching goals** and themes for the upcoming quarter(s) will be. Finally we will guide you through **setting SMART goals**.

##### Step 0: Know yourselves 👩🏿👨🏼🧔🏼👱🏻‍♀️🧑🏼👩🏽👨🏾 [60 min] [_optional_]
_While this is optional it is strongly recommended, especially if you have new people on the team!_

We will start by getting to know each other. We will create instruction manuals for each team member outlining preferred communication platforms, languages, project types, etc. This aims to help get to know how to effectively work with your team and to give you a better idea what work your team enjoys doing.

##### Step 1: Know your team team & initiatives 🙌 [60 min + 45 min * number of initiatives]
In the previous step we got to know team members individually. Now, we will focus on the team as a whole. As part of this we will review _all_ current initiatives. These current initiatives will be documented to ensure a common understanding of current initiatives. We will also do a retrospective for each initiative and for the team's work as a whole.

##### Step 2: Know your org & products 🧐 [30 min + 1h * number of products]
To start with, we will examine the org and teams around us, including their target areas. This will allow us to see and avoid overlaps. Next, we will get to know our products more intimately. We will perform segmentation exercises for each product. We will document the findings to ensure a common understanding of each products target audience. You may find during this step that you start having ideas around new initiatives for certain products - write these down!

##### Step 3: Define themes 🧞‍♀️ [1h]
You may have many current initiatives or many ideas for new initiatives. In this section we will define overarching goals or themes. These will in the next steps allow us to set more concrete goals. Best of all, this will give you a framework to decide whether you should spend time on X or not!

##### Step 4: Define Event Strategy 💃 [2h?]
If your team does a lot of event work, it is advisable to create an event strategy. (...)

##### Step 5: Set SMART goals 🏃‍♀️ [4h]
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timely. Those are the keywords that you need to keep in mind for this section. These SMART goals will describe what your team is planning to do in the coming quarter(s). Each project/initiative the team is undertaking should have some goals attached to it. We will also consider metrics in this section.

##### Step 6: Documentation 📜 [2h]
Pull everything together. This is the last task for the person leading this workshop. In this, you will create an overall reference document/folder where your team's strategy is clearly defined. This will be invaluable throughout the next quarter's in keeping you goal-oriented. It will also be a good resource to have at hand when doing your yearly review!

### Preparation 👈

If you are planning to use this for a team planning workshop, I suggest you go through the entire step by step guide _before_ you start the workshop.

I suggest creating a team repository or a Google Drive folder for this session. This will allow you to keep all materials/documentation that you produce in one place.

##### Materials 🗝
- post-its & felt pens
- tape
- print outs of the materials for each section

### FAQ 🤔
**⏳ How long does the entire step by step process take?**
Here's a nifty formula that should give you an idea:

**`Time in hours = 12.5 + 1 * Number of Products + 0.75 * Number of Initiatives`**

Or if you prefer a python 🐍 program:
```python
def time_to_complete(num_products, num_initiatives):
  time_in_hours = 11.5 + 1 * num_products + 0.75 * num_initiatives
  return time_in_hours

> time_to_complete(3, 9)
22.25
```

**👋 Can I contribute?**
Yes! Contributions are very welcome. Please create an issue to discuss what you would like to contribute first and then create a PR.

**💼 Can I use this in my company?**
Yes! Please note the `license.md` file. If you would like a professional developer advocate consultant to help you I suggest you reach out to the fantastic [Matthew Revell](https://matthewrevell.com/), [Cristiano Betta](https://betta.io/), or [Mary Thengvall](https://www.marythengvall.com/about/).

**😳 Do we really need this?** Yes. Defining your strategy will help your team and your stakeholders understand what you are doing. It will give you the tools to see whether you are reaching goals and having the impact you want to see. On top of that, it gives your superiors a chance to understand what you are doing and why you are doing it. Hopefully this will ensure your team's value will be obvious (and avoid people thinking you are a resource sinkhole for monetary resources).

**👩🏼‍💻 Who are you?**
I'm [Naomi](https://twitter.com/naomi_pen) and I love thinking about strategy. Personally, I think I do my best work when I see how my work aligns with strategic goals and when I can justify to myself and other why I am spending time doing X. To help with that, I created this guide for my team and for other teams to create a methodolical approach to defining your developer relations strategy. Strategy is, of course, not the only thing I love. I also _love_ ✨ emoji ✨, [samoyeds](https://weheartit.com/entry/307342706), my niblings, and [writing](http://blog.naomi.codes/).
