## Naomi's User Manual

### My style
- I tend to have lots of ideas. I jot ideas down in a Kanban-like board that I then use to organize myself. If there is something I want to do, I will either find a path or make one.

- I enjoy strategizing and ensuring everything is on track. I like documented and efficient processes. If I find things that seem broken I will try to fix them.

- I believe in direct communication. If I notice problems or hear of problems I will address them and occasionally pass aggregated feedback of others on (generally without mentioning names).

- I am not a fan of following a rule for the rule's sake. I tend to question both the status quo and rules. If rules are not self explanatory, I will question them.

### What I value
- I value trust, honesty, and loyalty. If someone proves dishonest, breaks my trust, or behaves disrespectfully it will be very hard to rebuild that.

- I like to be included. CC me on everything that relates to me or what I work on. Invite me to meetings - if they are optional, tell me and I will decide whether to attend or not. I do not like to hear from third parties about what is going on, especially when it pertains to me or my work.

- Small things make me happy. That can be a well-made balloon animal, meeting a good dog, and various other random things.

### What I donâ€™t have patience for
- People who do things just because they've _always been done that way_ and who reject discussion around changing the status quo.

- Meetings that have no agenda. Every meeting should come with a description. If your meeting could be an email, then make it an email.

- Being told not to worry about it instead of having my questions answered. If I asked, it means I care.

- Privilege and isms. We are a product of our surroundings.

- Being asked questions you don't really want to know the answer to. We can skip the small talk about our families and our weekends.

### How to best communicate with me
- I like emails and slack. Emails will get my attention quicker generally. CC me on anything that relates to me.

- I avoid phone calls where possible. Video calls are marginally better.

- I use emoji often. They help get emotion across and that leads to more effective communication.  

- If you need something from me I would prefer you got straight to the point instead of going through 5 minutes of "Hi, how are you?".

- I like to receive feedback in person. If you schedule a meeting with me, please let me know what it will be about. This avoids me spending time thinking about what the meeting will be about.

### How to help me
- I will often question whether I am doing the right work/getting enough done. Communicating expectations clearly helps me know where I am at.

- Help me find the people who I need to talk to to get things done.

- Be straight-forward with me.

### What people misunderstand about me
- People sometimes think I am intimidating. Please never feel you cannot talk to me. I'd love to get to know you and explore ideas and things we can work on together!

- I need time to think things through. It will sometimes take me a few days before I provide feedback. That is not because I didn't want to address the subject in the moment but because I needed time to digest the information.

- I am an introvert. I gain energy from being alone.
